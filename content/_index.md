Yo! I'm a fairly laid back & easy going guy. I'm currently a student (middle college) studying IT, Systems Administration, DevOps, Networking, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science/Information Systems. However, my skillset lies specifically with Full-Stack Development, Networking, Automation and Linux Systems Administration.

Anyways, feel free to look around, and contact me (LinkedIn is the best place atm) if you have any questions at all!

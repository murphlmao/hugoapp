Yo. 

As you may have read earlier, I'm a pretty easy-going guy. I'm persistent 
with strong feelings towards things I truly believe in, & 
have a love for technology, piano, content creation, & basketball.

I'm currently a student working towards my Associate's Degree at CC, 
then I'm probably going to transfer to a university and go for something Computer Science / 
Computer Information Systems related. Or not. Who knows.

My love for technology started when I was about 4-5, when my cousin & sister started introducing me to
some of the stuff the things they were interested in! This included but was not limited to gaming, videography,
content creation, music, and so, so much more. At 5 years old, unbeknownst to my parents, I had actually
started taking apart the home computer, and putting it back together. And there it was, my first PC build
at 5 years old.

From there, I heavily dived into gaming. I got to the competitive level of many games 
like CS:GO (FPL), Minecraft ([Yep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow8ipShBHN4). [Mhm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1EHUBDeaPg)), 
Overwatch (Kinda), etc. Otherwise, single player open-world games are my favorite (and some old school platformers).

I did commissions for a good while when I was younger (2015-2021). This included PC building, network configuration, 
light development work, etc. This got me paid more often than not, but hey if they bailed on that, I always got a nice, firm handshake
and thank you... ðŸ¥²

At 17, going into my senior year of HS, I got my first job at a fairly small-medium 
sized company called Prism Controls (formerly PMSI) as an IT Assistant. 
Eventually, due to my education & skills from prior self-employment work, my role eventually evolved 
into a position with New Product Development, which included automation, development, hardware configuration, 
DevOps, etc. This is really where my interest & career in development and solutions took off. 

Skip to August, and my senior year starts. At this point I'm working & attending 2 different schools (One is a career center with a class in the morning) 
My second year teacher at the career center believed in a 'hands off' approach, and let us decide  what to do all day. 
This, as you can imagine, was a very wise decision. We as restless seniors used our time breathtakingly. Don't believe me? 
You're going to tell me nap day wasn't productive? K.

After many debates with the teacher, I finally just took it upon myself to start teaching my peers the valuable networking, hardware, 
HelpDesk, & scripting skills I had aquired through mostly through my work. Eventually, this evolved into a role where I was teaching a 
group of accelerated first year students to prepare them for the first part of the CompTIA A+ test (1101). Ironically, I didn't even 
have my A+ certification yet (I still don't), but was still quite qualified to teach them.

Those stories give you a little bit of a dive into how I got to the place where I am today. Obviously there's a ton of stuff that 
sits in between those events & now, but none of THAT really demonstrates who I am. Those, hopefully, do. 

We are about a year into the future now. I'm just taking it easy, taking it one day at a time.

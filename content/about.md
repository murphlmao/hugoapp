Yo. 

As you may have read earlier, I'm a pretty easy-going guy. I'm persistent 
with strong feelings towards things I truly believe in, occasionally stubborn, & 
have a love for technology, piano, & basketball.

I'm currently a student working towards my Associate's Degree at CC (full ride), 
then I'm probably going to transfer to a university and go for something Computer Science / 
Computer Information Systems related. I attended a Tech Center (KCTC) while a Junior/Senior in High School
for their IT/Networking & CyberSecurity program, and gained a ton of valuable skills there. 

My love for technology started when I was about 4-5, when my cousin & sister started introducing me to
some of the stuff they did. This included mostly gaming, but also videography, working with
cool looking computer software, and music. At 5 years old, unbeknownst to my parents, I had actually
started taking apart the home computer, and putting it back together. And there it was, my first PC build
at 5 years old.

From there, I heavily dived into gaming. I got to the competitive level of many games 
like CS:GO (FPL), Minecraft ([Yep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow8ipShBHN4). [Mhm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1EHUBDeaPg)), 
Overwatch (Kinda), etc. Otherwise, single player open-world games are my favorite (and some old school platformers).

I did commissions for a good while when I was younger (2015-2021). This included PC building, network configuration, 
light development work, etc. This got me paid a little bit, but more often than not I just 
received a handshake & a thank you. Know your worth kids.

At 17, going into my senior year of HS, I got my first job at a fairly small-medium 
sized company called Prism Controls (was called PMSI at the time of joining) as an IT Assistant. 
Eventually, due to my education & skills from prior self-employment work, my role eventually evolved 
into a position with New Product Development. 

With my new role in NPD, I was tasked with automating a particular configuration we 
had to do apply to cameras that we shipped customers. Normally an entire batch would
take about an hour for someone to hand configure, I shrunk that down to under 10 minutes.
From there, I was assigned to develop a fairly large full-stack application project. 
Together, me & my boss got this application off the ground and deploying to customer sites 
in about 6 weeks, with most of my work being front-end & back-end focused, and his focus being 
split on developing a CI/CD pipeline, packaging, & testing. By this time, my senior year was already well under way.

During the first 6 months of working, I gained a ridiculous amount of knowledge of things that
often take college courses years to start covering. OOP, advanced networking, embedded Linux, and 
a bunch of other boring terms that are on my resume/CV. 

My teacher at KCTC for my second year was very uninterested in teaching us 'Advanced IT' skills,
despite what the course name would imply. He believed in a 'hands off' approach, and let us decide 
what to do all day. Which, as you can imageine, we as restless seniors in High School decided to use that time very valuably.
My personal favorite was Nap Day, when half of the class fell asleep (seriously). Despite many protests & conversations 
with him about his approach, he did not seem to be willing to change. 

From there, I took it upon myself to start teaching my peers the valuable networking, hardware, 
HelpDesk, & scripting skills I had aquired through my work & prior experience. Eventually, this 
evolved into a role where I was teaching a group of accelerated first year students to prepare them 
for the first part of the CompTIA A+ test (1101). Ironically, I didn't even have my A+ certification yet, 
but was still more than qualified to teach them.

But here we are now. Graduation is just around the corner for me, and I'm still as bored as ever.

Hopefully that gives you an in depth look at who I *really* am. I chose to share these moments in particular 
because I think each one of these stories, in it's own way, shows what kind of person I am. And that's what this is about, right?
I'm passionate, stubborn, and I fight for what I believe in. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty in order to do what I think is right.

To close this on a solemn note, most of that passion, stubbornness, and drive you keep hearing about 
comes from a place of *love*. I love what I do, I love technology, and I love helping other people 
come to love technology... Even if I literally have to become the teacher ;).

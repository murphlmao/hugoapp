##### Q: Who are you and what is this website/blog about?      
A: I'm a developer, IT, and DevOps guy with a very broad & versatile skillset. 
This website is really just a testament to that. 
```
```

##### Q: What inspired you to create this website/blog?     
A: This is my 3rd revision of my site hosted on GitHub Pages. This time around, 
I used Hugo and a CI/CD pipeline that builds & deploys my app. 
I mostly do this for fun, but it was also time I stepped away from just HTML & CSS 
and moved to proper front-end development & generation tools/frameworks. 

Hugo is just a static site generator, future revisions of my site might include proper 
Front-End frameworks like React, Svelte, Angular, etc...

```
```

##### Q: How frequently do you update your website/blog?     
A: Tough to say. During the summer, it's entirely possible I'll have more 
time to shell out for this, 
but I'm often kept fairly busy by my work, school, and living the dream
```
```

##### Q: Can I contact you directly through this website/blog?     
A: No, however feel free to contact me through LinkedIn.

##### Q: Do you have a social media presence? Which platforms can I find you on?

```
```

##### Q: Can I use your content or images for my own personal use or on my own website/blog?     
A: Feel free. Give credit where credit is due, however. 
```
```

##### Q: Are you open to feedback or suggestions for your website/blog?     
A: Always. Just create an issue on [this](https://github.com/murphlmao/murphlmao.github.io) repository, and submit your ideas.
```
```

##### Q: How can I support you?     
A: By not being a terrible human being & treating others with common decency. 

In terms in monetary support, that's on a roadmap for the future.
```
```

##### Q: Do you have any disclaimers or disclosures for sponsored content or affiliate links?     
A: No, I'm too boring unfortunately.
```
```

##### Q: Do you have any upcoming events or projects related to your website/blog?     
A: I have some cool development projects in mind (some that I can share, others that I can't), 
but it's hard to find the time to get that kind of stuff done. Developing applications is hard & very time consuming,
even on relatively small scales, take this website for example, which in total has taken about 15ish hours of work to get done,
but has been spanned over the course of about a month.

Yo. I'm a laid back & easy going guy who's currently a HS & middle college student who's
studying IT, DevOps, Networking, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science.
I have over a decade of experience as a JSWE & IT consultant, which mostly comes from self employment work.

Anyways, I've a burning passion for all of the above mentioned, 
but I also enjoy teaching, music, keyboards, basketball, running, Cowboy Bebop, and long walks on the beach.
